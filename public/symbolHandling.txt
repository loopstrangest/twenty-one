Two types of symbols: numbers and operators
3 operators in Operators.tsx and 4 Numbers in Numbers.tsx must be used...
...to form an equation in Equation.tsx
Equation order: number operator number operator number operator number
Equation example: 4 / 2 + 3 * 8
When a number is clicked in Numbers.tsx, the number is added to the first...
available correct place in Equation.tsx (1st or 3rd or 5th or 7th location)
When an operator is clicked in Numbers.tsx, the operator is added to the first...
available correct place in Equation.tsx (2nd or 4th or 6th location)
When a symbol is clicked in Equation.tsx, that symbol disappears from...
the equation and returns to its Numbers / Operators location.

Remember that duplicate symbols can be present.

I want "global" states for Numbers and Operators to be kept track of in Game.tsx,
and passed down to Numbers, Operators, and Equation.
The global states must keep track of:
The symbol itself. When the symbol is clicked from Numbers or Operators,
it is disabled in Numbers or Operators and placed and enabled in the
first available spot in Equation.
When a symbol is clicked from Equation, it is disabled and removed from
Equation and enabled in Numbers or Operators.
